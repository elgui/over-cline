# Getting Started with Over-Cline | New Coders

Welcome to Over-Cline! This guide will help you get set up and start using Over-Cline to build your first project.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   **VS Code:** A free, powerful code editor.
    -   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Development Tools:** Essential software for coding (Homebrew, Node.js, Git, etc.).
    -   Follow our [Installing Essential Development Tools](installing-dev-essentials.md) guide to set these up with Over-Cline's help (after getting setup here)
    -   Over-Cline will guide you through installing everything you need
-   **Over-Cline Projects Folder:** A dedicated folder for all your Over-Cline projects.
    -   On macOS: Create a folder named "Over-Cline" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/Over-Cline`
    -   On Windows: Create a folder named "Over-Cline" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\Over-Cline`
    -   Inside this Over-Cline folder, create separate folders for each project
        -   Example: `Documents/Over-Cline/workout-app` for a workout tracking app
        -   Example: `Documents/Over-Cline/portfolio-website` for your portfolio
-   **Over-Cline Extension in VS Code:** The Over-Cline extension installed in VS Code.

## Step-by-Step Setup

Follow these steps to get Over-Cline up and running:

1. **Open VS Code:** Launch the VS Code application. If VS Code shows "Running extensions might...", click "Allow".

2. **Open Your Over-Cline Folder:** In VS Code, open the Over-Cline folder you created in Documents.

3. **Navigate to Extensions:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code.

4. **Search for 'Over-Cline':** In the Extensions search bar, type "Over-Cline" (or the publisher name "elgui").

5. **Install the Extension:** Click the "Install" button next to the Over-Cline extension.

6. **Open Over-Cline:** Once installed, you can open Over-Cline in a few ways:
    - Click the Over-Cline icon in the Activity Bar.
    - Use the command palette (`CMD/CTRL + Shift + P`) and type "Over-Cline: Open In New Tab" to open Over-Cline as a tab in your editor. This is recommended for a better view.
    - **Troubleshooting:** If you don't see the Over-Cline icon, try restarting VS Code.
    - **What You'll See:** You should see the Over-Cline chat window appear in your VS Code editor.

## Setting up OpenRouter API Key

Now that you have Over-Cline installed, you'll need to set up your OpenRouter API key to use Over-Cline's full capabilities.

1.  **Get your OpenRouter API Key:**
    -   [Get your OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/)
2.  **Input Your OpenRouter API Key:**
    -   Navigate to the settings button in the Over-Cline extension.
    -   Input your OpenRouter API key.
    -   Select your preferred API model.
        -   **Recommended Models for Coding:**
            -   `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`: Most used for coding tasks.
            -   `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`: A free option for coding.
            -   `deepseek/deepseek-chat`: SUPER CHEAP, almost as good as 3.5 sonnet

## Your First Interaction with Over-Cline

Now you're ready to start building with Over-Cline. Let's create your first project folder and build something! Copy and paste the following prompt into the Over-Cline chat window:

```
Hey Over-Cline! Could you help me create a new project folder called "hello-world" in my Over-Cline directory and make a simple webpage that says "Hello World" in big blue text?
```

**What You'll See:** Over-Cline will help you create the project folder and set up your first webpage.

## Tips for Working with Over-Cline

## FAQs

-   **What is the Terminal?** The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It allows you to run commands to perform various tasks, such as installing packages, running scripts, and managing files. Over-Cline uses the terminal to execute commands and interact with your development environment.
